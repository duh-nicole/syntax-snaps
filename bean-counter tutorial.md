# Bean-Counter Tutorial 🍵
*Track your records, one cozy bean at a time.*

## 🌱 What I Built
I created this project to initally fulfill a class assignment. I am slowly updating it to become more user friendly.

It is a data management system. Built to be simple and functional. Easy to understand prompts. 

I wanted to practice: 
- collecting user input
- displaying it dynamically on the page
- saving or clearing entries easily
- making it clean, calm, and easy to use

Bean-Counter is a great starting point if you're learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔄 Possible Extensions

If you’re feeling spicy, try adding:
- Local storage (save entries even if the page reloads)
- Editable entries
- Tags or filters
- Light/dark mode toggle

## ♿ Accessibility Notes

I tried to keep it screen-reader friendly:
- All form fields use proper `<label>` tags
- Keyboard users can tab through each input and button
- Visual contrast kept cozy but readable
